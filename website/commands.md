# Commands

Hey there, here we'd like to show you the ways, how to see our commands. There are two different ways to see all our commands.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attention! We use our default prefix. Please note, that you can set your own prefix with `?prefix <prefix>`
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First way" %}
First you can see it on our [**website**](https://lenoxbot.com/commands). There is an overview of each module and you can also search a command.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second way" %}
The second way is over the bot itself.

Just type `?commands` or `?cmds` and the Name of the module, of which you'd like to see the commands. An example:

* `?commands Searches` **/** `?cmds Searches`
