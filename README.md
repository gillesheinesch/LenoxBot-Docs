# LenoxBot

**Welcome on the Documentation of LenoxBot!**

LenoxBot was created on **5th September 2017**. Since then we have released over **2000** updates and spent over **1000** hours making the bot more user-friendly than any other bot!

Our goal was and still is to provide every botuser an all-in bot so he doesn't have to invite 10 other bots for all the features that he wants to have on his discord server.

We released our own website including the dashboard in May and it offers you a place where you can set up almost all settings of the bot via your browser!

If you are a **new** user of LenoxBot, I would advise you to read on 

{% page-ref page="getting-started.md" %}

so that you will **quickly** become familiar with LenoxBot!
